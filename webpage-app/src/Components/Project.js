            Checkfront receives bulk booking data from their clients which can widely vary in both format and data type from client to client. 
            They seek to streamline the process of importing large quantities of booking information so that 
            Checkfront can save time, resources, and also improve turn-around for their clients. This project will 
            increase ease-of-use for both the technical and non-technical Checkfront team members.
